## Code of Conduct ##

This project is dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity. Members do not tolerate harassment for any reason, but especially harassment based on gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, nationality, sex, color, ethnic or social origin, pregnancy, citizenship, familial status, veteran status, genetic information, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, age, or preference of text editor.


### Expected Behavior ###

All participants in our events and communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others. All interactions should be professional regardless of platform: either online or in-person. In order to foster a positive and professional working environment we encourage the following kinds of behaviors in all work events, activities, and platforms:

 * Use welcoming and inclusive language
 * Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
 * Gracefully accept constructive criticism
 * Focus on what is best for the community
 * Show courtesy and respect towards other community members

Note: See the [four social rules](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules) for further recommendations.

### Unacceptable Behavior ###

Harassment is any form of behavior intended to exclude, intimidate, or cause discomfort. Prohibited harassing behavior includes, but is not limited to:

* written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people
* causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidating
* the display of sexual or violent images
* unwelcome sexual attention
* non-consensual or unwelcome physical contact
* sustained disruption of talks, events, or communications
* incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm
* continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop

and

* publication of private comment without consent

This list should not be taken to be exhaustive, but rather as a guide to make it easier to enrich our community and all those in which we participate. All interactions should be professional regardless of location: Harassment is prohibited whether it occurs on or offline, and the same standards apply to both.

Enforcement of this Code of Conduct will be respectful and not include any harassing behaviors.


You deserve sincere thanks for helping to make this a welcoming, friendly community for all.
