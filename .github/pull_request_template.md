* [ ] All new code is appropriately documented (user-facing code _must_ have complete docstrings).
* [ ] Added a ``news`` entry, or the changes are not user-facing.
* [ ] Ran pre-commit by making a comment with `pre-commit.ci autofix` before requesting review.

* [ ] [GPU integration tests](https://github.com/OpenFreeEnergy/openfe/actions/workflows/gpu-integration-tests.yaml)
* [ ] [example notebook testing](https://github.com/OpenFreeEnergy/openfe/actions/workflows/test-example-notebooks.yaml)
