    """Radial Network generator

    Also known as hub and spoke or star-map, this plans a Network where
    all ligands are connected via a central ligand.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ligands : iterable of Molecules
      the ligands to arrange around the central ligand
    central_ligand : Molecule
      the ligand to use as the hub/central ligand
    mappers : iterable of AtomMappers
      mappers to use, at least 1 required
    scorer : scoring function, optional
      a callable which returns a float for any AtomMapping.  Used to assign
      scores to potential mappings, higher scores indicate worse mappings.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
      if no mapping between the central ligand and any other ligand can be
      found

    Returns
    -------
    network : Network
      will have an edge between each ligand and the central ligand, with the
      mapping being the best possible mapping found using the supplied atom
      mappers.
      If no scorer is supplied, the first mapping provided by the iterable
      of mappers will be used.
