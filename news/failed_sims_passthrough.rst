**Added:**

* `openfe gather` includes failed simulations in its output, with `Error` listed instead of a computed value, instead of simply omitting those results from the output table.
* `openfe gather` checks for connectivity of the results network and throws an error if the network is disconnected or has fewer than 3 edges.
* `openfe gather` prints warnings for all results JSONs whose simulations have failed or are otherwise invalid.
