**Added:**

* Added experimental features ``openfe gather-septop`` and ``openfe gather-abfe``, which are analogous to ``openfe gather`` and allow for gathering results generated by the Separated Toplogies and Absolute Binding Free Energy protocols, respectively.  These commands are experimental and are liable to be changed in a future release.
