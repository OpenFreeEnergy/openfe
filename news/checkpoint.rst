**Changed:**

* The checkpoint interval default frequency has been increased to every
  nanosecond. `real_time_analysis_interval` no longer needs to be divisible
  by the checkpoint interval, allowing users of the HybridTopologyProtocol
  and AbsoluteSolvationProtocol to write checkpoints less frequently and
  yielding smaller file sizes.
