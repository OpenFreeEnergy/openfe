**Changed:**

* We have vendored the perses atom mapper and scorer.
  This means the ``perses`` package is no longer needed to use the ``perses`` atom mapper and scorer.
  However, OpenEye is still needed to use the ``perses`` atom mapper and scorer.
  This is an internal packaging change and does not affect user scripts.
