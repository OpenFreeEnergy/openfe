If you want to implement your own atom mapper or free energy procedure, or you want to do something a bit more bespoke, it's helpful to understand how OpenFE thinks about individual alchemic mutation specifications. A :class:`Transformation` stores all the information needed to run an alchemic mutation from one chemical system to another and is the basic unit of an OpenFE simulation campaign. Indeed, :class:`Transformation` objects describe the edges of the graph in the :class:`AlchemicalNetwork` class.
