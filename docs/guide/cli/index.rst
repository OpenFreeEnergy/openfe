CLI Interface
=============

In addition to the powerful Python API, OpenFE provides a simple command
line interface to facilitate some more common (and less complicated) tasks.
The Python API tries to be as easy to use as possible, but the CLI provides
wrappers around some parts of the Python API to make it easier to integrate
into non-Python workflows.
