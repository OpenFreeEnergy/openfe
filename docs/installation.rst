Installation
============

The page has information for installing ``openfe``, installing software
packages that integrate with ``openfe``, and testing that your ``openfe``
installation is working.

``openfe`` currently only works on POSIX system (macOS and UNIX/Linux). It
is tested against Python 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11.

When you install ``openfe`` through any of the methods described below, you
will install both the core library and the command line interface (CLI). 

If you already have a Mamba installation, you can install ``openfe`` with:

.. parsed-literal::

  mamba create -c conda-forge -n openfe_env openfe=\ |version|
  mamba activate openfe_env

Note that you must run the latter line in each shell session where you want to use ``openfe``. OpenFE recommends the Mamba package manager for most users as it is orders of magnitude faster than the default Conda package manager. Mamba is a drop in replacement for Conda.

.. note::
   If you plan on using GAFF to parametrize your system, you **must** install ``openmmforcefields`` version ``0.12.0``.
   This will create an environment with python 3.10 and the correct version of Ambertools.

   ``mamba create -c conda-forge -n openfe_env openfe=1 openmmforcefields=0.12.0``

Installation with ``miniforge`` (recommended)
----------------------------------------------

.. _Miniforge: https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge?tab=readme-ov-file#miniforge

We recommend installing ``openfe`` with `Miniforge`_ because it provides easy
installation of other software that ``openfe`` needs, such as OpenMM and
AmberTools. We recommend ``miniforge`` because it is faster than ``conda`` and
comes preconfigured to use ``conda-forge``.

To install and configure ``miniforge``, you need to know your operating
system, your machine architecture (output of ``uname -m``), and your shell
(in most cases, can be determined from ``echo $SHELL``). Select
your operating system and architecture from the tool below, and run the
commands it suggests.

    <pre><span id="miniforge-curl-install"></span></pre>
    <script>
      function setArchitectureOptions(os) {
          let options = {
              "MacOSX": [
                  ["x86_64", ""],
                  ["arm64", " (Apple Silicon)"]
              ],
              "Linux": [
                  ["x86_64", " (amd64)"],
                  ["aarch64", " (arm64)"],
                  ["ppc64le", " (POWER8/9)"]
              ]
          };
          choices = options[os];
          let htmlString = ""
          for (const [val, extra] of choices) {
              htmlString += `<option value="${val}">${val}${extra}</option>`;
          }
          let arch = document.getElementById("miniforge-architecture");
          arch.innerHTML = htmlString
          updateInstructions()
      }

      function updateInstructions() {
          let cmd = document.getElementById("miniforge-curl-install");
          let osElem = document.getElementById("miniforge-os");
          let archElem = document.getElementById("miniforge-architecture");
          let shellElem = document.getElementById("miniforge-shell");
          let os = osElem[osElem.selectedIndex].value;
          let arch = archElem[archElem.selectedIndex].value;
          let shell = shellElem[shellElem.selectedIndex].value;
          let filename = "Miniforge3-" + os + "-" + arch + ".sh"
          let cmdArr = [
              (
                  "curl -OL https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/"
                  + "releases/latest/download/" + filename
              ),
              "sh " + filename + " -b",
              "~/miniforge3/bin/mamba init " + shell,
              "rm -f " + filename,
          ]
          cmd.innerHTML = cmdArr.join("\n")
      }

      setArchitectureOptions("Linux");  // default
    </script>

You should then close your current session and open a fresh login to ensure
that everything is properly registered.

Next we will create an environment called ``openfe_env`` with the ``openfe`` package and all required dependencies:

.. parsed-literal::

  mamba create -n openfe_env openfe=\ |version|

Now we need to activate our new environment ::

  mamba activate openfe_env


.. warning::

   Installing on Macs with Apple Silicon requires a creating an x86_64
   environment, as one of our requirements is not yet available for Apple
   Silicon. Run the following modified commands

   .. parsed-literal:: 

      CONDA_SUBDIR=osx-64 mamba create -n openfe_env openfe=\ |version|
      mamba activate openfe_env
      mamba env config vars set CONDA_SUBDIR=osx-64

To quickly check this is working, run the tests ::

  openfe test

The very first time you run this, the
initial check that you can import ``openfe`` will take a while, because some
code is compiled the first time it is encountered. That compilation only
happens once per installation.
  
A more expansive test suite can be run using ::

  openfe test --long
  
This test suite contains several hundred individual tests. This may take up to
an hour, and all tests should complete with status either passed,
skipped, or xfailed (expected fail).
This "long" test suite should be run as a job on the compute
hardware intended to run openfe jobs, as it will test GPU specific features.

With that, you should be ready to use ``openfe``!

Single file installer
---------------------

.. _releases on GitHub: https://github.com/OpenFreeEnergy/openfe/releases

Single file installers are available for x86_64 Linux and MacOS. 
They are attached to our `releases on GitHub`_ and can be downloaded with a browser or ``curl`` (or similar tool).
For example, the Linux installer can be downloaded with ::

  $ curl -LOJ https://github.com/OpenFreeEnergy/openfe/releases/latest/download/OpenFEforge-Linux-x86_64.sh

And the MacOS installer ::

  $ curl -LOJ https://github.com/OpenFreeEnergy/openfe/releases/latest/download/OpenFEforge-MacOSX-x86_64.sh

The single file installer contains all of the dependencies required for ``openfe`` and does not require internet access to use.

Both ``conda`` and ``mamba`` are also available in the environment created by the single file installer and can be used to install additional packages.
The installer can be installed in batch mode or interactively  ::
  
  $ chmod +x ./OpenFEforge-Linux-x86_64.sh # Make installer executable
  $ ./OpenFEforge-Linux-x86_64.sh # Run the installer

      Thank you for installing OpenFEforge!

After the installer completes, close and reopen your shell. 
To check if your path is setup correctly, run ``which python`` your output should look something like this ::

   (base) $ which python
   /home/mmh/openfeforge/bin/python

.. note::
   Your path will be different, but the important part is ``openfeforge/bin/python``

Now the CLI tool should work as well ::

   (base) $ openfe --help
   Usage: openfe [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...
   
     This is the command line tool to provide easy access to functionality from
     the OpenFE Python library.
   
   Options:
     --version   Show the version and exit.
     --log PATH  logging configuration file
     -h, --help  Show this message and exit.
   
   Setup Commands:
     atommapping        Check the atom mapping of a given pair of ligands
     plan-rhfe-network  Plan a relative hydration free energy network, saved in a
                        dir with multiple JSON files
     plan-rbfe-network  Plan a relative binding free energy network, saved in a
                        dir with multiple JSON files.
   
   Simulation Commands:
     gather    Gather DAG result jsons for network of RFE results into single TSV
               file
     quickrun  Run a given transformation, saved as a JSON file

To make sure everything is working, run the tests ::

  $ pytest --pyargs openfe openfecli

The test suite contains several hundred individual tests. This will take a
few minutes, and all tests should complete with status either passed,
skipped, or xfailed (expected fail).
  
With that, you should be ready to use ``openfe``!

Containers
----------

We provide an official docker and Apptainer (formerly Singularity) image.
The docker image is tagged with the version of ``openfe`` on the image and can be pulled with ::

  $ docker pull ghcr.io/openfreeenergy/openfe:latest

The Apptainer image is pre-built and can be pulled with ::

  $ singularity pull oras://ghcr.io/openfreeenergy/openfe:latest-apptainer

.. warning::

   For production use, we recommend using version tags to prevent disruptions in workflows e.g.
   
   .. parsed-literal::

     $ docker pull ghcr.io/openfreeenergy/openfe:\ |version|
     $ singularity pull oras://ghcr.io/openfreeenergy/openfe:\ |version|-apptainer

We recommend testing the container to ensure that it can access a GPU (if desired).
This can be done with the following command ::

  $ singularity run --nv openfe_latest-apptainer.sif python -m openmm.testInstallation
  
  OpenMM Version: 8.0
  Git Revision: a7800059645f4471f4b91c21e742fe5aa4513cda

  There are 3 Platforms available:

  1 Reference - Successfully computed forces
  2 CPU - Successfully computed forces
  3 CUDA - Successfully computed forces

  Median difference in forces between platforms:

  Reference vs. CPU: 6.29328e-06
  Reference vs. CUDA: 6.7337e-06
  CPU vs. CUDA: 7.44698e-07

  All differences are within tolerance.

The ``--nv`` flag is required for the Apptainer image to access the GPU on the host.
Your output may produce different values for the forces, but should list the CUDA platform if everything is working properly. 

You can access the ``openfe`` CLI from the Singularity image with ::

  $ singularity run --nv openfe_latest-apptainer.sif openfe --help

To make sure everything is working, run the tests ::

  $ singularity run --nv openfe_latest-apptainer.sif pytest --pyargs openfe openfecli

The test suite contains several hundred individual tests. This will take a
few minutes, and all tests should complete with status either passed,
skipped, or xfailed (expected fail).
  
With that, you should be ready to use ``openfe``!

Developer install
-----------------

If you're going to be developing for ``openfe``, you will want an
installation where your changes to the code are immediately reflected in the
functionality. This is called a "developer" or "editable" installation.

Getting a developer installation for ``openfe`` first installing the
requirements, and then creating the editable installation. We recommend
doing that with ``mamba`` using the following procedure:

First, clone the ``openfe`` repository, and switch into its root directory::

  $ git clone https://github.com/OpenFreeEnergy/openfe.git
  $ cd openfe

Next create a ``conda`` environment containing the requirements from the
specification in that directory::

  $ mamba create -f environment.yml

Then activate the ``openfe`` environment with::

  $ mamba activate openfe_env

Finally, create the editable installation::

  $ python -m pip install --no-deps -e .

Note the ``.`` at the end of that command, which indicates the current
directory.

Optional dependencies
---------------------

Certain functionalities are only available if you also install other,
optional packages.

* **perses tools**: To use perses, you need to install perses and OpenEye,
  and you need a valid OpenEye license. To install both packages, use::

    $ mamba install -c openeye perses openeye-toolkits

HPC Environments
----------------

When using High Performance Computing resources, jobs are typically submitted to a queue from a "login node" and then run at a later time, often on different hardware and in a different software environment.
This can complicate installation as getting something working on the login node does not guarantee it will work in the job.
We recommend using `Apptainer (formerly Singularity) <https://apptainer.org/>`_ when running ``openfe`` workflows in HPC environments.
This images provide a software environment that is isolated from the host which can make workflow execution easier to setup and more reproducible.
See our guide on :ref:`containers <installation:containers>` for how to get started using Apptainer/Singularity.

.. _installation:mamba_hpc:

``mamba`` in HPC Environments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _virtual packages: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-virtual.html#managing-virtual-packages

We recommend using a :ref:`container <installation:containers>` to install ``openfe`` in HPC environments.
Nonetheless, ``openfe`` can be installed via Conda Forge on these environments also.
Conda Forge distributes its own CUDA binaries for interfacing with the GPU, rather than use the host drivers.
``conda``, ``mamba`` and ``micromamba`` all use `virtual packages`_ to detect and specify which version of CUDA should be installed.
This is a common point of difference in hardware between the login and job nodes in an HPC environment.
For example, on a login node where there likely is not a GPU or a CUDA environment, ``mamba info`` may produce output that looks like this ::

  $ mamba info

We can see that there is a virtual package ``__cuda=11.7=0``.
This means that if we run a ``mamba install`` command on a node with a GPU, the solver will install the correct version of the ``cudatoolkit``.
However, if we ran the same command on the login node, the solver may install the wrong version of the ``cudatoolkit``, or depending on how the Conda packages are setup, a CPU only version of the package.
We can control the virtual package with the environmental variable ``CONDA_OVERRIDE_CUDA``.

In order to determine the correct ``cudatoolkit`` version, we recommend connecting to the node where the simulation will be executed and run ``nvidia-smi``.
For example ::

  $ nvidia-smi

  +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

in this output of ``nvidia-smi`` we can see in the upper right of the output ``CUDA Version: 11.7`` which means the installed driver will support a ``cudatoolkit`` version up to ``11.7``

So on the login node, we can run ``CONDA_OVERRIDE_CUDA=11.7 mamba info`` and see that the "correct" virtual CUDA is listed.
For example, to install a version of ``openfe`` which is compatible with ``cudatoolkit 11.7``, run:

.. parsed-literal::

  $ CONDA_OVERRIDE_CUDA=11.7 mamba create -n openfe_env openfe=\ |version|

Troubleshooting Your Installation
---------------------------------

We have create a script that can be ran locally to assist in troubleshooting errors.
The script does not upload any information and the output may be inspected before the output is sent to us.
We recomend running the script in the same environment where the error was observed.
For example, if you had an error when creating a system on your local workstation, run the script locally with the same conda environment active as when the error occurred.
If the error occurred when running the job on an HPC resource, then run the script (ideally) on the same node where the problem occurred. 
This helps to debug issues such as a CUDA and NVIDIA driver mismatch (which would be impossible to diagnose if the script was ran on a login node without a GPU).

The script is available here: https://github.com/OpenFreeEnergy/openfe/blob/main/devtools/debug_openmm.sh
For your convenience, this command will download the script and save the output as ``debug.log``

.. parsed-literal::


  $ bash -c "$(curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenFreeEnergy/openfe/main/devtools/debug_openmm.sh)" | tee -a debug.log

The output of the script will also be printed to standard out as it is executed.
While no sensitive information is extracted, it is good practice to review the output before sending it or posting it to ensure that nothing needs to be redacted.
For example, if your python path was ``/data/SECRET_COMPOUND_NAME/python`` then that would show up in ``debug.log``.

 
Common Errors
-------------

openmm.OpenMMException: Error loading CUDA module: CUDA_ERROR_UNSUPPORTED_PTX_VERSION (222)
  This error likely means that the CUDA version that ``openmm`` was built with is incompatible with the CUDA driver.
  Try re-making the environment while specifying the correct CUDA toolkit version for your hardware and driver.
  See :ref:`installation:mamba_hpc` for more details.


Supported Hardware
------------------

We currently support the following CPU architectures:

* ``linux-64`` 
* ``osx-64``
* ``osx-arm64``

For simulation preparation, any supported platform is suitable.
We test our software regularly by performing vacuum transformations on ``linux-64`` using the OpenMM CUDA platform.
While OpenMM supports OpenCL, we do not regularly test that platform (the CUDA platform is more performant) so we do not recomend using that platform without performing your own verification of correctness.
For production use, we recomend the ``linux-64`` platform with NVIDIA GPUs for optimal performance.
When using an OpenMM based protocol on NVIDIA GPUs, we recomend driver version ``525.60.13`` or greater.
The minimum driver version required when installing from conda-forge is ``450.36.06``, but newer versions of OpenMM may not support that driver version as CUDA 11 will be removed the build matrix.
