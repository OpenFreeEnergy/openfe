Reference
=========

This contains details of the Python API as well as a reference to the
command line interface.

.. note::
   We have reproduced API documentation from the `GUFE`_ package here for convenience.
   The GUFE package serves as a foundation layer for openfe, providing abstract base classes and object models, and so might be more useful for developers.
