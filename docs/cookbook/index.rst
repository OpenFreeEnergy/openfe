Cookbook
========

This section describes common tasks involving the OpenFE Python API.

The :any:`OpenFE CLI<cli-reference>` provides a simple way to perform the most common procedures for free energy calculations, but does not provide much flexibility for fine-tuning your approach or combining OpenFE with other tools. The :any:`Python API<api>` allows that flexibility, but using it is more complex. This cookbook breaks down common steps that would be implemented in Python to help navigate that complexity.

.. note:: This section is a work-in-progress.

The Basic Workflow
------------------

The typical way to use the Python API is to load a number of molecules you want to calculate free energies of, construct a :class:`LigandNetwork` connecting them in an efficient way, and then combine that with information for how each ligand should be simulated to construct an :class:`AlchemicalNetwork`, which specifies the entire simulation campaign. This provides a lot of flexibility in how molecules are specified, mapped, connected, and simulated, without exposing a great deal of complexity. OpenFE recommends this workflow for most users.
