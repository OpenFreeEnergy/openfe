# The Setup Module

The ``openfe.setup`` submodule is designed to contain all the tools you will
require to create a free energy calculation.

## Network planning

Network planning refers to the process of creating routes between the ligands
that you wish to calculate free energy values for.  This results in a graph,
where nodes are ligands and edges are the alchemical state we must simulate
along to determine their relative energy.


### Loading your data

Loading files.

### Creating your Network

Simple radial network.

### Saving your data.

### Components of the Network creation process

The Network 

#### LigandAtomMapper

We need a cartographer.

#### Scorer

How good is this?

#### Network Strategy.

How to use these pieces of info.

## System setup

With a Network defined, we can now move onto creating an alchemical system
for each edge on the Network.
