Tutorials
=========

.. todo: make sure we can inline the tutorial, for now we only provide links

OpenFE has several tutorial notebooks which are maintained on our
`Example Notebooks repository <https://github.com/OpenFreeEnergy/ExampleNotebooks>`_.
For new users, we recommend the following two:


Relative Free Energies CLI tutorial
-----------------------------------

The `Relative Free Energies with the OpenFE CLI <https://github.com/OpenFreeEnergy/ExampleNotebooks/blob/main/rbfe_tutorial/cli_tutorial.md>`_
tutorial walks users through how to use the OpenFE command line to calculate
relative hydration free energies from a small set of benzene modifications.

Associated with it is also a `notebook <https://github.com/OpenFreeEnergy/ExampleNotebooks/blob/main/rbfe_tutorial/python_tutorial.ipynb>`_
for how to achieve the same outcomes using the Python API.

Python API Showcase
-------------------

Our `showcase notebook <https://github.com/OpenFreeEnergy/ExampleNotebooks/blob/main/openmm_rbfe/OpenFE_showcase_1_RBFE_of_T4lysozyme.ipynb>`_
walks users through how to use the main components of OpenFE to create a
relative binding free energy calculation.
